/*In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable 
�
x with 
�
N terms. The polynomial looks like 


i−1for all 
(1≤i≤N).

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.*/
